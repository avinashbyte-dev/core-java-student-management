# Core Java Student Management System

- A console-based Core Java project that demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and efficient data management using the Collections Framework.

- This project is designed as a learning-focused, real-world style application to build a solid Java foundation before moving into backend and full-stack development.


## 🚀 Features (Phase 2)

- Add a student with unique ID validation
- Update student details (name, marks, etc.)
- Delete a student by ID
- Display student details by ID
- Display all stored students
- Graceful handling of invalid inputs
- Clean separation between logic and presentation


## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Classes & Objects
- Constructors
- this keyword
- Encapsulation (private fields + getters/setters)
- Package structure
- HashMap (Collections Framework)
- Enhanced for-loop
- Method overriding (toString)
- Separation of Concerns (Model – Service – Main)

## 🎯 Learning Objective

To strengthen Core Java fundamentals by building a real-world style application using OOP and collections, forming a strong base for:

- Java Backend Development
- Spring Boot
- Full Stack Java Development
- DSA and system design readiness

## 📌 Future Enhancements
