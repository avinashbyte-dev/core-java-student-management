# 🎓 Core Java Student Management System

- A console-based Core Java application that demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and efficient data handling using the Java Collections Framework.

- This project is built as a learning-focused, real-world style application to strengthen Core Java fundamentals before moving into Java backend and full-stack development.


## 🚀 Features (Phase 2)

- Add a student with unique ID validation

- Update student details (name and marks)

- Delete a student by ID

- View student details by ID

- View all stored students

- Check if a student exists by ID

- Graceful handling of invalid inputs using exceptions

- Menu-driven console interface

- Clean separation between logic and presentation layers


## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Classes & Objects

- Constructors & `final` keyword

- Encapsulation (private fields + getters/setters)

- Packages and modular structure

- `HashMap` for data storage

- Enhanced for-loops

- Method overriding (`toString`, `equals`, `hashCode`)

- Separation of Concerns (Model → Service → Main)

- Custom exceptions and validation utilities

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   git clone <https://github.com/avinashbyte-dev/core-java-student-management.git>

2. Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)

3. Compile and run Main.java

4. Use the menu to add, view, update, and delete students


## 🎯 Learning Objective

To build a strong foundation in Core Java by developing a real-world style application using OOP principles and Collections, preparing for:

- Strengthen Core Java fundamentals

- Practice OOP design patterns

- Prepare for Java backend & full-stack development

- Build a foundation for DSA and system design readiness

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- File-based data persistence

- Custom exception handling- Menu-driven UI with better error handling

- Improved validations and error handling

- Sorting and searching features

- Migration to Spring Boot backend (REST APIs)
