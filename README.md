# 🎓 Core Java Student Management System

- A console-based Core Java application that demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and efficient data handling using the Java Collections Framework.

- This project is built as a learning-focused, real-world style application to strengthen Core Java fundamentals before moving into Java backend and full-stack development.


## 🚀 Features (Phase 2)

- Add a student with unique ID validation

- Update student details (name and marks)

- Delete a student by ID

- View student details by ID

- View all stored students

- Check if a student exists by ID

- Graceful handling of invalid inputs

- Menu-driven console interface

- Clean separation between logic and presentation layers


## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Classes & Objects

- Constructors

- this keyword

- Encapsulation (private fields + getters/setters)

- Package-based project structure

- HashMap (Collections Framework)

- Enhanced for loop

- Method overriding (toString())

- Separation of Concerns (Model – Service – Main)
